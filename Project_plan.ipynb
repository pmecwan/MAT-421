        "Earthquake data, such as that collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), provides critical insights into seismic activity, including magnitude, location, and depth. However, real-world datasets often contain missing or incomplete values due to sensor limitations or recording errors, particularly for depth measurements in remote or older events. Accurate depth estimates are essential for understanding earthquake mechanics and assessing their potential impact, as depth influences ground shaking and tsunami risk. This project aims to estimate missing earthquake depth values using mathematical techniques—Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation, Cubic Spline Interpolation, and Simple Linear Regression—applied to real earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake Catalog (earthquake.usgs.gov). The Newton-Raphson Method will be explored to refine regression parameters."

        "Interpolation and regression techniques have long been used to handle missing data in scientific fields, including seismology. Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation has been applied to estimate geophysical variables, such as temperature or pressure, in studies like those by Press et al. (2007), offering exact fits through known points but risking oscillation with higher-degree polynomials. Cubic Spline Interpolation, favored for its smoothness and stability, has been used in atmospheric and oceanic datasets (e.g., de Boor, 2001), making it a candidate for seismic depth estimation. Simple Linear Regression is a staple in geophysics for trend analysis, such as correlating depth with magnitude (Hanks & Kanamori, 1979), though it assumes linearity. The Newton-Raphson Method, while typically used for root-finding, has been adapted to optimize regression fits in numerical studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Public earthquake datasets, like the USGS Catalog and Kaggle’s “Significant Earthquakes” dataset, provide depth, magnitude, and location data, often with gaps. Prior work suggests interpolation outperforms regression for spatial continuity, but regression may capture broader trends. This project adapts these methods to estimate missing depths, comparing their accuracy against known values."

Cubic Spline Interpolation should outperform Lagrange, with MAE of 1-3 km and RMSE of 4-6 km, reflecting its smoothness and adaptability to seismic depth variations. Simple Linear Regression is anticipated to have higher errors (MAE 5-7 km, RMSE 10-12 km) due to oversimplification, though Newton-Raphson refinement may reduce RMSE by 1-2 km by fine-tuning the fit.\n",

Regression will likely show a weak trend (e.g., deeper events with higher magnitude), limited by non-linear seismic dynamics. These results could aid in completing USGS records, with splines preferred for spatial continuity and regression for trend insights. Limitations include sensitivity to data density (interpolation) and predictor choice (regression). Future work could explore multivariate regression or higher-order splines with additional features like fault proximity."
